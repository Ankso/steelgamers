Minecraft Theme for Vanilla Forums by Sandon 'clethrill' Joubert

Mostly experimental but can also be used as a plug and play sort of forum thing
for you minecraft server, if you have any suggestion or find any bug don't be shy
I can't bite from my computer chair.

Now on github https://github.com/clethrill/Minecraft-Theme/tree/master/Minecraft-Theme
